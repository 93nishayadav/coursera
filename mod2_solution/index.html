<h1>Types Of Chocolate</h1>
<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">
    <h2>Cacao</h2>
    <p>
       This is the cacao bean, minus the shell, and nothing else. You can buy cacao raw or roasted. Whole cacao is the whole bean, cacao nibs are crunched up pieces of bean, and ground cacao is powdered. Really the healthiest form of chocolate there is, cacao can sometimes be quite bitter.
    </p>
</div>
<div   class="col-lg-4  col-md-6">
    <h2>Unsweetened Chocolate</h2>
    <p>
       Chocolate liquor that has been allowed to cool and harden. It is used for baking and to make other types of chocolate. Many bakers prefer this type of chocolate for baking because they have more control over the flavor and sweetness.
    </p>
</div>
<div   class="col-lg-4 col-md-12">
  <h2>White Chocolate</h2>
    <p>
        White chocolate is not technically one of the types of chocolate because it does not contain any chocolate liquor. It must contain at least 20% cocoa butter and 14% milk, plus sugar in varying amounts.
